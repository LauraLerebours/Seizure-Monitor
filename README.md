# Seizure-Monitor
Monitoring seizures in low risk patients using accelerometer
This code should be used in congjunction with the ADXL343 accelerometer. This project has the basic logic for a seizure detection system.
Future improvements
- More accurate seizure detection
- Integrate into Adafruit.io for public use
- Emergency Contact notification system
